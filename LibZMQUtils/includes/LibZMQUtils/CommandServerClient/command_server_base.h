 * @class CommandServerBase
 *
 * @brief This class provides the base structure for a ZeroMQ based command server.
 *
 * The CommandServerBase class encapsulates the common logic and functionality for a server that communicates over the
 * ZeroMQ messaging infrastructure. It provides the basic mechanics for starting, stopping, and managing a server, and
 * for handling client connections, commands, and responses.
 *
 * This base class is designed to be inherited by subclasses that provide specific implementations for various callback
 * functions to handle server events such as the start/stop of the server, client connections/disconnections, receiving
 * invalid or custom commands, and server errors. This design allows the creation of specialized servers for different
 * use cases while keeping the core logic generic and reusable.
 *
 * The server created with this class operates asynchronously, with the main server tasks running in a separate thread.
 * It is capable of managing multiple client connections, processing command requests, and sending responses. The
 * server also provides optional functionalities such as checking the alive status of connected clients.
 *
 * @section Pattern
 *
 * This class extends the ZeroMQ's standard REQ-REP pattern, also known as the Request-Reply pattern, to allow the
 * client to send commands to the server, which then processes these commands using appropriate callbacks for
 * execution. In a typical REQ-REP pattern, there is a strict send-and-receive order between the client and server. The
 * client (REQ) sends a request to the server and then waits for the reply. Similarly, the server (REP) waits for a
 * request, and once it  receives one, it sends a reply. This cycle then repeats in a strict alternating order,
 * ensuring that each request receives a corresponding reply.
 *
 * This strict request-reply cycle is essential when controlling certain hardware devices or low-level software modules,
 * where the order of commands and their corresponding responses is critical. By ensuring a strict request-reply order,
 * we can maintain consistent control over the devices and modules and reduce the risk of command conflicts or overlaps.
 *
 * In the extended pattern provided by this class, each request from the client is essentially a command that the
 * server must execute. To handle this, we define a set of commands that the client can send, and we provide
 * corresponding callback functions on the server to execute when it receives these commands. The result of the
 * command execution is then sent back to the client as the reply.
 *
 * By extending the pattern in this way, we create a flexible and robust framework for controlling a wide range of
 * hardware devices and software modules, while maintaining the strict request-reply order that ensures reliable and
 * consistent operation.
 *
 * It is important to mention that, for other cases in which the strict request-reply cycle is not necessary, other
 * approaches could be more interesting, such as the use of an infrastructure based on RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
 *
 * @section Case Of Use
 *
 * This communication pattern is particularly beneficial when controlling generic hardware devices like PLC or
 * microcontroller based devices, FPGA devices, generic custom robots etc. Also can be used in specialized devices,
 * like telescope mounts, domes, SLR Range Gate Generators (RGG), etc.
 *
 * In all these examples, the concatenation between replies and responses is crucial. For example, this base server is
 * used in the ROA SLR Station in San Fernando, Spain, for control the RGG, the telescope mount, dome, and other
 * specialized low-level software modules.
 *
 * @section Design
 *
 * This base class is designed to be inherited by subclasses that provide specific implementations for various callback
 * functions to handle server events such as start/stop of the server, client connections/disconnections, receiving
 * invalid or custom commands, and server errors. This design allows for creating specialized servers for different use
 * cases while keeping the core logic generic and reusable.
 *
 * The server operates asynchronously, with main server tasks running in a separate thread. It is capable of managing
 * multiple client connections, processing command requests, and sending responses. The server also provides optional
 * functionalities such as checking the alive status of connected clients.
 *
 * @section Usage
 *
 * To use this class, create a subclass and override the callback functions according to your needs. Also you can define
 * the custom commands and the custom errors related with the sublcass, as well as extend the containers that contains
 * the string representation of the commands and errors.
 *
 * Then, create an instance of your subclass, and use the startServer and stopServer methods to control the server's
 * operation. You can query the server's state and information using the various getters. You can also use
 * setClientStatusCheck to control the checking of clients' alive status.
 *
 * A similar usage pattern applies to the CommandClientBase class, which is meant to interact with a CommandServerBase
 * instance. CommandClientBase is also designed to be subclassed with callback methods to be overridden for specific
 * client behaviors. Therefore, a typical usage scenario involves creating subclassed instances of both classes
 * CommandServerBase and CommandClientBase, where the server handles commands sent by the client.
 *
 * Remember that error handling must be done in the subclass. That is, if an unexpected error occurs on the server, the
 * server will not try to resolve it itself, nor will it try to stop the server. The subclasses are in charge of this
 * management, which can be different depending on each use case.
 *
 * @section Hierarchy
 *
 * The following functions need to be overriden in your subclass:
 *
 * - validateCustomCommand(ServerCommand)
 *
 * The following callbacks need to be overridden in your subclass:
 *
 * - onServerStop()
 * - onServerStart()
 * - onWaitingCommand()
 * - onConnected(const HostClient&)
 * - onDisconnected(const HostClient&)
 * - onDeadClient(const HostClient&)
 * - onInvalidMsgReceived(const CommandRequest&)
 * - onCommandReceived(const CommandRequest&)
 * - onCustomCommandReceived(const CommandRequest&, CommandReply&)
 * - onServerError(const zmq::error_t &error, const std::string& ext_info)
 * - onSendingResponse(const CommandReply&)
 *
 * Among these callbacks, onCustomCommandReceived is crucial because it handles all custom commands. This function
 * receives a command request and a command reply as parameters. It is intended to deserialize the input parameters
 * from the command request, execute the custom command, and then serialize the output parameters into the command
 * reply. Therefore, it is necessary to override this function to add handling for the custom commands specific to
 * your server's application.
 *
 * Finally, also remember add the virtual destructor to the subclass.
 *
 * @note This class is not directly useful on its own. Instead, it is intended to be subclassed and its callback
 * methods overridden to implement the desired server behavior.
 *
 * @warning Client-Specific Data:
 *
 * This server includes client-specific information, including IP address, hostname, Process ID (PID), and
 * client name, in its communications. This approach aids the server in identifying which client issues commands,
 * thereby improving operational visibility and control. Client-specific data can be useful in generating
 * detailed logs which can be analyzed to gain insights into system behavior, user activity, and potential issues.
 *
 * Although in certain contexts it may not be advisable or necessary to include such client information, we recommend
 * retaining this feature for this server class. This enhances the robustness and traceability of server-client
 * interactions, particularly in environments where precise command control and operational accountability are crucial.
 *
 * @warning Security Measures:
 *
 * This server implementation does not provide any built-in security measures, such as authentication or encryption.
 * As a result, the server is potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access or eavesdropping. It is critical to control
 * the server's network connections using external means, like a firewall or VPN. Always ensure that the network
 * environment in which the server operates is secure.
 *
 * @warning Overridden callbacks with computationally intensive operations:
 *
 * When creating a subclass, ensure that blocking or computationally intensive operations are not present within the
 * overridden callbacks. Blocking the server thread can affect the server's performance and responsiveness. If
 * complex tasks are necessary, consider performing them asynchronously or using separate threads.
 *
 * However, it is necessary to remember that this pattern is designed for the control of low-level hardware equipment
 * and similar, so cases like the previous one should not be common.
 *
 * @todo Future Enhancements:
 *
 * Future versions of this server should include built-in security measures. Specifically, we plan to implement
 * support for ZeroMQ's security mechanisms, such as CurveZMQ for public-key encryption and ZAP for authentication.
 * These enhancements will provide a robust layer of security and significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
 *
 * Add a method to easily send large data divided in chunks with progress communication.
