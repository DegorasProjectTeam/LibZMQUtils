LibZMQUtils TODOs


PRIORITY:

- Add a queue functionality to publisher. The idea is that send msg always will be blocking and something like addToPublishQueue is non blocking to avoid performance issues.

- Improve concurrency control in client.

- Add a toolchain to facilitate the compilation for ARM (like RPi devices or FPGAs).

- Add security with CURVE and encryption.

- Cancel client operation functionality.

- Non blocking senmdMsg operation mode with futures in client. 

- Add a command to get server info.

- Make the internal utilities independent of generic infrastructure and move them to the DegorasBase library

- Move template implementations to tpp.

NO PRIORITY:

- Future log functionality with auto publisher. When LibDegorasBase ready.

- Multiple endpoints to the same port.

- Add a function to known the ping value in msec (connection delay).
 
- Add public IP for client and server (configurable for remote and local only). 

- Add a system to allow certains clients (only locals for example) to have access to certain commands.

- Add a system to allow always the connection of a local client for administrative operations.

- Add a command to get all the info of connected clients and enable/disable the access to this command by clients.

- Add a command to close the server (by external client with access to that operation).

- Add a function to, in the server, check the version of the client and check compatibility with current server version.
